<h1 align="center">MIT6.5840 (6.824) - Replication of Distributed System Course Labs</h1>

Replication of the Spring 2023 MIT6.5840 (previously known as 6.824) Distributed Systems Labs

This project involves the lab exercises from MIT's 6.824 Distributed Systems course, primarily developed in the Go programming language.

# 1 Project Structure

## 1.1 Branches
The project is divided into 9 branches, each precisely corresponding to a part of each lab in the course, named in the format Lab2A, Lab2B, etc.
Each branch contains detailed documentation, **including case studies of bug fixes, explanations of concepts, detailed analysis of test functions, and answers to frequently asked questions (which may come up in interviews)**.
I believe that this step-by-step branching method will be helpful, as I was confused when referring to other people's code that included content from later labs, which was difficult to understand and riddled with bugs.
Repository structure:

## 1.2 Usage Instructions:
To ensure the program runs without bugs, test each part at least 1000+ times; I achieved 0 bugs in 1000 tests.
Then use the dstest script in each file for testing, which contains the usage rules.

This project is a personal interpretation and implementation of the MIT 6.824 course. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to raise them.

Finally, I wish every participant gains something in their journey of learning distributed systems!

# 2 Disclaimer
I intended to use this project for campus recruitment, so I put a lot of effort into it. Thanks to the power of GPT-4, I was able to understand many concepts that were initially unclear to me, through the comprehensive analyses provided by GPT-4.
